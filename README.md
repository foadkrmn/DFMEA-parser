# DFMEA Parser

A Python script for parsing and processing DFMEA (Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) Excel files.

## Features

- Splits rows based on semicolon-separated values
- Handles multiple entries in Recommended Actions column
- Manages Comments column entries
- Interactive replacement of values
- Preserves original data while creating processed versions

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- openpyxl

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/foadkrmn/DFMEA-parser.git
cd DFMEA-parser
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy openpyxl
```

## Example File

The repository includes a generic example Excel file (`example_DFMEA_Coolant_Valve.xlsx`) that demonstrates the expected format. Please note:
- This is a generic DFMEA file generated by ChatGPT for demonstration purposes only
- The data and content are not real-world examples
- It serves only to show how the script processes and modifies the data
- Contains "Recommended Actions" and "Comments" columns
- Has semicolon-separated values in the Recommended Actions column

## Usage

1. Either use the example file or place your Excel file in the same directory as the script
2. Run the script:
```bash
python DFMEA_parser
```
3. Follow the prompts to:
   - Enter the Excel file name (e.g., "example_DFMEA_Coolant_Valve.xlsx")
   - Specify the Recommended Actions column name
   - Specify the Comments column name
   - Review and modify entries as needed

## Output

The script generates:
- A processed Excel file with split rows
- Updated entries based on user modifications
- Preserved original data in separate columns
